# Repository Access Control Guide

## Your Repository: unobtrix/Project-1

## How to Check Who Can See Your Code

### Step 1: Check Repository Visibility
1. Go to: https://github.com/unobtrix/Project-1
2. Look for the visibility badge:
   - Public = Anyone on the internet can see your code
   - Private = Only you and invited collaborators can see it

### Step 2: Check Collaborators
1. Click Settings tab
2. Click 'Collaborators and teams' in the left sidebar
3. See the list of people/teams with access

## Current Access Status

### If Repository is PUBLIC:
- EVERYONE can see your FarmTrails business code!
- Any GitHub user, search engines, competitors

### If Repository is PRIVATE:
- Only you (unobtrix) and invited collaborators
- Your business code is protected

## Making Your Repository Private (IMPORTANT!)

### Why This Matters:
- Protect your unique algorithms and features
- Prevent competitors from copying your work
- Keep FarmTrails innovations private

### How to Make it Private:
1. Go to: https://github.com/unobtrix/Project-1
2. Click Settings tab
3. Scroll to 'Danger Zone'
4. Click 'Change repository visibility'
5. Select 'Make private'
6. Confirm the change

## Security Checklist
- [ ] Repository is PRIVATE (not public)
- [ ] Only trusted collaborators have access
- [ ] No unnecessary admin access given
- [ ] Regular access reviews

## What Happens When You Make it Private
- Deployments (Netlify, Render) still work
- Git operations still work
- Public cannot see your code anymore
